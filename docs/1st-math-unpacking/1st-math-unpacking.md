## Standards for Mathematical Practice

| Practice |  | Explanation and Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Make sense of | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade continue to develop the ability to focus attention, test hypotheses, take reasonable risks, |
| problems and |  | remain flexible, try alternatives, exhibit self-regulation, and persevere (Copley, 2010). As the teacher uses thoughtful questioning and |
| persevere in |  | provides opportunities for students to share thinking, First Grade students become conscious of what they know and how they solve |
| solving them. |  | problems. They make sense of task-type problems, find an entry point or a way to begin the task, and are willing to try other approaches |
|  |  | when solving the task. They ask themselves, "Does this make sense?" First Grade students' conceptual understanding builds from their |
|  |  | experiences in Kindergarten as they continue to rely on concrete manipulatives and pictorial representations to solve a problem, |
|  |  | eventually becoming fluent and flexible with mental math as a result of these experiences. |
| 2. Reason |  | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade recognize that a number represents a specific quantity. They use numbers and symbols |
| abstractly and |  | to represent a problem, explain thinking, and justify a response. For example, when solving the problem: "There are 60 children on the |
| quantitatively. |  | playground. Some children line up. There are 20 children still on the playground. How many children lined up?" first grade students may |
|  |  | write 20 + 40 = 60 to indicate a Think-Addition strategy. Other students may illustrate a counting-on by tens strategy by writing 20 + 10 + |
|  |  | 10 + 10 + 10 = 60. The numbers and equations written illustrate the students' thinking and the strategies used, rather than how to simply |
|  |  | compute, and how the story is decontextualized as it is represented abstractly with symbols. |
| 3. | Construct | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade continue to develop their ability to clearly express, explain, organize and consolidate |
| viable |  | their math thinking using both verbal and written representations. Their understanding of grade appropriate vocabulary helps them to |
| arguments and |  | construct viable arguments about mathematics. For example, when justifying why a particular shape isn't a square, a first grade student |
| critique the |  | may hold up a picture of a rectandle, pointing to the various parts, and reason, "It can't be a square because, even though it has 4 sides |
| reasoning of |  | and 4 angles, the sides aren't all the same size." In a classroom where risk-taking and varyinq perspectives are encouraged, |
| others. |  | mathematically proficient students are willing and eager to share their ideas with others, consider other ideas proposed by classmates, |
|  |  | and question ideas that don't seem to make sense. |
| 4. | Model with | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade model real-life mathematical situations with a number sentence or an equation, and |
| mathematics. |  | check to make sure that their equation accurately matches the problem context. They also use tools, such as tables, to help collect |
|  |  | information, analyze results, make conclusions, and review their conclusions to see if the results make sense and revising as needed. |
| 5. Use |  | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade have access to a variety of concrete (e.g. 3-dimensional solids, ten frames, number |
| appropriate |  | balances, number lines) and technological tools (e.g., virtual manipulatives, calculators, interactive websites) and use them to investigate |
| tools |  | mathematical concepts. They select tools that help them solve and/or illustrate solutions to a problem. They recognize that multiple tools |
| strategically. |  | can be used for the same problem- depending on the strategy used. For example, a child who is in the counting stage may choose |
|  |  | connecting cubes to solve a problem. While, a student who understands parts of number, may solve the same problem using ten-frames |
|  |  | to decompose numbers rather than using individual connecting cubes. As the teacher provides numerous opportunities for students to |
|  |  | use educational materials, first grade students' conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking skills are developed. |
| 6. Attend to |  | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade attend to precision in their communication, calculations, and measurements. They are |
| precision. |  | able to describe their actions and strategies clearly, using grade-level appropriate vocabulary accurately. Their explanations and |
|  |  | reasoning regarding their process of finding a solution becomes more precise. In varying types of mathematical tasks, first grade students |
|  |  | pay attention to details as they work. For example, as students' ability to attend to position and direction develops, they begin to notice |
|  |  | reversals of numerals and self-correct when appropriate. When measuring an object, students check to make sure that there are not any |
|  |  | gaps or overlaps as they carefully place each unit end to measure the object (iterating length units). Mathematically proficient first |
|  |  | grade students understand the symbols they use (= >,<) and use clear explanations in discussions with others. For example, for the |
|  |  | sentence 4 > 3, a proficient student who is able to attend to precision states, "Four is more than 3" rather than "The alligator eats the four. |
|  |  | It's bigger." |

| 7. Look for and | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade carefully look for patterns and structures in the number system and other areas of |
| --- | --- |
| make use of | mathematics. For example, while solving addition problems using a number balance. students recognize that regardless whether you put |
| structure. | the 7 on a peg first and then the 4, or the 4 on first and then the 7, they both equal 11 (commutative property). When decomposing two- |
|  | digit numbers, students realize that the number of tens they have constructed 'happens' to coincide with the digit in the tens place. When |
|  | exploring geometric properties, first graders recognize that certain attributes are crilical (number of sides, angles), while other properties |
|  | are not (size, color, orientation). |
| 8. Look for and | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade begin to look for reqularity in problem structures when solving mathematical tasks. For |
| express | example, when adding three one-digit numbers and by making tens or using doubles, students engage in future tasks looking for |
| regularity in | opportunities to employ those same strategies. Thus, when solving 8+7+2, a student may say, "I know that 8 and 2 equal 10 and then I |
| repeated | add 7 more. That makes 17. It helps to see if I can make a 10 out of 2 numbers when I start." Further, students use repeated reasoning |
| reasoning. | while solving a task with multiple correct answers. For example, in the task "There are 12 crayons in the box. Some are red and some are |
|  | blue. How many of each could there be?" First Grade students realize that the 12 crayons could include 6 of each color (6+6 = 12), 7 of |
|  | one color and 5 of another (7+5 = 12), etc. In essence, students repeatedly find numbers that add up to 12. |

## Represent and solve problems.

NC.1.OA.f Represent and solve addition and subtraction word problems, within 20, with unknowns, by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem, when solving:

- · Add to/Take from-Change Unknown
- Put together/Take Apart-Addend Unknown
- · Compare-Difference Unknown

| Clarification | Checking for Understanding |
| --- | --- |
| Change unknown and addend unknown problems allow students to begin to see subtraction as |  |
| the opposite of addition. Developing the understanding of subtraction as an unknown addend |  |
| addition problem is an essential goal for later mathematics. As students work with change |  |
| unknown and addend unknown problems, they will record situation equations (equations in |  |
| which the operation and order of numbers matches the situation of the problem). Eventually, |  |
| students notice that a problem may be solved with other solution equations (equations that |  |
| lead to the answer, but do not match the situation of the story). |  |
| In a Compare situation, two amounts are compared to find "How many more" or "How many |  |
| less/fewer". Students build on their understanding of equal to, more than, and less than for two |  |
| groups of objects or two numbers. Strategies for determining which the difference in quantities |  |
| include matching and counting. |  |
| Difference Unknown |  |
| "How manv more?" version |  |
| Compare |  |
| As First Graders work with a variety of problem types, they extend the sophistication of addition |  |
| and subtraction methods used in Kindergarten (counting). Now, students use methods of |  |
| counting on, making ten, and doubles +/- 1 or +/- 2 to solve problems. Students also use a |  |
| variety of models, including discrete objects and length-based models (e.q., cubes connected |  |
| to form lengths). |  |
| In order for students to read and use equations to represent their thinking, they need extensive |  |
| experiences with addition and subtraction situations in order to connect the experiences with |  |
| symbols (+. -. =) and equations (5=3+2). In Kindergarten, students demonstrated the |  |
| understanding of how objects can be joined (addition) and separated (subtraction) by |  |
| representing addition and subtraction situations using objects, pictures and words. In First |  |
| Grade, students extend this understanding of addition and subtraction situations to use the |  |
| addition symbol (+) to represent joining situations, the subtraction symbol (-) to represent |  |
| separating situations, and the equal sign (=) to represent a relationship regarding quantity |  |
| between one side of the equation and the other. When solving comparison problems, students |  |
| may write various equations to represent comparisons. |  |
| For a complete chart of problem types see page 30. |  |

| NC.1.G.1 Distinquish between defining and non-defining attributes and create shapes with defining attributes by: |  |
| ● Building and drawing triangles, rectangles, squares, trapezoids, hexagons, circles. |  |
| Building cubes, rectanqular prisms, cones, spheres, and cylinders. |  |
| . |  |
| Clarification Checking for Understanding |  |
| In this standard, students use defining and non-defining attributes of shapes | Build a shape from these popsicle sticks. What shape did you make? How do |
| to identify, name, build and draw shapes. Students understand that defining vou know? |  |
| attributes are always present features that classify a particular object such as |  |
| number of sides, lengths of sides, and number of angles. They also |  |
| understand that non-defining attributes are features that may be present, but | I used popsicle sticks to build a square. I know it's a square |
| do not identify what the shape is called (e.g., color, size, orientation, etc.). | because all 4 sides are the same length and it has 4 right |
| corners. |  |
| For Example: |  |
| All triangles must be closed |  |
| figures and have 3 straight sides. |  |
| These are defining attributes. |  |
|  | I built a rectangle. I know this is a rectangle |
| Triangles can be different colors, | because it has 4 sides and 4 square corners. |
| sizes and be turned in different |  |
| directions. These are non-defining |  |
| attributes. |  |
| In this standard, students apply their understanding of defining attributes of |  |
| shapes in order to create, by building or drawing, given shapes. |  |
| Students should be able to describe the two-dimensional shapes they build |  |
| by telling the number of sides and vertices it has. Students should be able to |  |
| identify the vertex (corner) as the location where to sides meet; however, it is |  |
| not necessary for 1st grade students to use the term vertex. Through analysis, |  |
| students should recognize that the length of sides is an important attribute |  |
| when naming shapes. First grade students should be able to identify the two- |  |
| dimensional shapes that are the faces of three-dimensional shapes. |  |
| Identifying the number of edges and vertices on a three-dimensional shape is |  |
| not an expectation of first grade. |  |
| Note: North Carolina has adopted the exclusive definition for a trapezoid. A |  |
| trapezoid is a quadrilateral with exactly one pair of parallel sides. |  |

## Reason with shapes and their attributes

NC.1.G.2 Create composite shapes by:

- · Making a two-dimensional composite shape using rectangles, squares, trapezoids, triangles, and half-circles naming the components of the new shape.
- · Makinq a three-dimensional composite shape using cubes, rectangular prisms, cones, and cylinders, naming the components of the new shape.

#### Reason with shapes and their attributes NC.1.G.3 Partition circles and rectangles into two and four equal shares. · Describe the shares as halves and fourths, as half of and fourth of. · Describe the whole as two of, or four of the shares. Explain that decomposing into more equal shares creates smaller shares . Clarification Checking for Understanding In this standard, students will be able to partition rectangles and circles of How can you and a friend share equally (partition) this piece of paper so that you both have the same amount of paper to paint a picture? various sizes into halves and fourths. Students should recognize that when something is cut into two equal pieces, each piece will equal one-half of its original whole. Students should also recognize that halves of two different wholes are not necessarily the same size, and thev should understand that decomposing equal shares into more equal shares results in smaller equal shares. Students should partition reqions into equal shares using a context (e.q., Possible responses: cookies, pies, pizza). Through experiences with multiple representations, Student A Student B students should use the words, halves and fourths, and the phrases half of I would split the paper right down the I would split it from corner to corner middle. That gives us 2 halves. I and fourth of to describe their thinking and solutions. Working with the "the (diagonally).

See, if we cut on the line, the parts are the same size. You can have only one slice of pizza. Which pizza should you pick your slice from if you want the biggest piece of pizza? The pizzas are the same size and are each divided into equal pieces. Explain how you know. Possible response: l would get more pizza if I took a slice from the pizza that is cut into two equal parts. The more equal slices there are, the smaller the pieces get. I wouldn't get as much pizza if l only got a fourth of the pizza instead of half of the pizza. Return to Standards
