As the teacher uses thoughtful questioning and |\\n| persevere in |  | provides opportunities for students to share thinking, First Grade students become conscious of what they know and how they solve |\\n| solving them. |  | problems. They make sense of task-type problems, find an entry point or a way to begin the task, and are willing to try other approaches |\\n|  |  | when solving the task. They ask themselves, \"Does this make sense?\" First Grade students\\' conceptual understanding builds from their |\\n|  |  | experiences in Kindergarten as they continue to rely on concrete manipulatives and pictorial representations to solve a problem, |\\n|  |  | eventually becoming fluent and flexible with mental math as a result of these experiences. |\\n| 2. | Reason | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade recognize that a number represents a specific quantity. They use numbers and symbols |\\n|  | abstractly and | to represent a problem, explain thinking, and justify a response. For example, when solving the problem: \"There are 60 children on the |\\n| quantitatively. |  | playground. Some children line up. There are 20 children still on the playground. How many children lined up?\" first grade students may |\\n|  |  | write 20 + 40 = 60 to indicate a Think-Addition strategy. Other students may illustrate a counting-on by tens strategy by writing 20 + 10 + |\\n|  |  | 10 + 10 + 10 = 60. The numbers and equations written illustrate the students\\' thinking and the strategies used, rather than how to simply |\\n|  |  | compute, and how the story is decontextualized as it is represented abstractly with symbols. |\\n| 3. | Construct | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade continue to develop their ability to clearly express, explain, organize and consolidate |\\n| viable |  | their math thinking using both verbal and written representations. Their understanding of grade appropriate vocabulary helps them to |\\n|  | arguments and | construct viable arguments about mathematics. For example, when justifying why a particular shape isn\\'t a square, a first grade student |\\n| critique the |  | may hold up a picture of a rectangle, pointing to the various parts, and reason, \"It can\\'t be a square because, even though it has 4 sides |\\n| reasoning of |  | and 4 angles, the sides aren\\'t all the same size.\" In a classroom where risk-taking and varying perspectives are encouraged, |\\n| others. |  | mathematically proficient students are willing and eager to share their ideas with others, consider other ideas proposed by classmates, |\\n|  |  | and question ideas that don\\'t seem to make sense. |\\n| 4. | Model with | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade model real-life mathematical situations with a number sentence or an equation, and |\\n| mathematics. |  | check to make sure that their equation accurately matches the problem context. They also use tools, such as tables, to help collect |\\n|  |  | information, analyze results, make conclusions, and review their conclusions to see if the results make sense and revising as needed. |\\n| 5. Use |  | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade have access to a variety of concrete (e.g. 3-dimensional solids, ten frames, number |\\n| appropriate |  | balances, number lines) and technological tools (e.g., virtual manipulatives, calculators, interactive websites) and use them to investigate |\\n| tools |  | mathematical concepts. They select tools that help them solve and/or illustrate solutions to a problem. They recognize that multiple tools |\\n| strategically. |  | can be used for the same problem- depending on the strategy used. For example, a child who is in the counting stage may choose |\\n|  |  | connecting cubes to solve a problem. While, a student who understands parts of number, may solve the same problem using ten-frames |\\n|  |  | to decompose numbers rather than using individual connecting cubes. As the teacher provides numerous opportunities for students to |\\n|  |  | use educational materials, first grade students\\' conceptual understanding and higher-order thinking skills are developed. |\\n| 6. | Attend to | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade attend to precision in their communication, calculations, and measurements. They are |\\n| precision. |  | able to describe their actions and strategies clearly, using grade-level appropriate vocabulary accurately. Their explanations and |\\n|  |  | reasoning regarding their process of finding a solution becomes more precise. In varying types of mathematical tasks, first grade students |\\n|  |  | pay attention to details as they work. For example, as students\\' ability to attend to position and direction develops, they begin to notice |\\n|  |  | reversals of numerals and self-correct when appropriate. When measuring an object, students check to make sure that there are not any |\\n|  |  | gaps or overlaps as they carefully place each unit end to end to measure the object (iterating length units). Mathematically proficient first |\\n|  |  | grade students understand the symbols they use (=, >,<) and use clear explanations in discussions with others. For example, for the |\\n|  |  | sentence 4 > 3, a proficient student who is able to attend to precision states, \"Four is more than 3\" rather than \"The alligator eats the four. |\\n|  |  | It\\'s bigger.\" |\\n\\n| 7. | Look for and | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade carefully look for patterns and structures in the number system and other areas of |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | make use of | mathematics. For example, while solving addition problems using a number balance, students recognize that regardless whether you put |\\n|  | structure. | the 7 on a peg first and then the 4, or the 4 on first and then the 7, they both equal 11 (commutative property). When decomposing two |\\n|  |  | digit numbers, students realize that the number of tens they have constructed \\'happens\\' to coincide with the digit in the tens place. When |\\n|  |  | exploring geometric properties, first graders recognize that certain attributes are critical (number of sides, angles), while other properties |\\n|  |  | are not (size, color, orientation). |\\n| 8. | Look for and | Mathematically proficient students in First Grade begin to look for regularity in problem structures when solving mathematical tasks. For |\\n|  | express | example, when adding three one-digit numbers and by making tens or using doubles, students engage in future tasks looking for |\\n|  | regularity in | opportunities to employ those same strategies. Thus, when solving 8+7+2, a student may say, \"I know that 8 and 2 equal 10 and then I |\\n|  | repeated | add 7 more. That makes 17. It helps to see if I can make a 10 out of 2 numbers when I start.\" Further, students use repeated reasoning |\\n|  | reasoning. | while solving a task with multiple correct answers. For example, in the task \"There are 12 crayons in the box. Some are red and some are |\\n|  |  | blue. How many of each could there be?\" First Grade students realize that the 12 crayons could include 6 of each color (6+6 = 12), 7 of |\\n|  |  | one color and 5 of another (7+5 = 12), etc. In essence, students repeatedly find numbers that add up to 12. |\\n\\n# **Operations and Algebraic Thinking**\\n\\n| Represent and solve problems. |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| NC.1.OA.1 Represent and solve addition and subtraction word problems, within 20, with unknowns, by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol |  |  |\\n| for the unknown number to represent the problem, when solving: |  |  |\\n| • Add to/Take from-Change Unknown |  |  |\\n| • Put together/Take Apart-Addend Unknown |  |  |\\n| • Compare-Difference Unknown |  |  |\\n| Clarification Checking for Understanding |  |  |\\n| In this standard, students extend their work from NC.K.OA.1 to solve addition and subtraction |  | Nine bunnies were sitting on the grass.

Developing the understanding of subtraction as an unknown addend |  |  |\\n| addition problem is an essential goal for later mathematics. As students work with change |  |  |\\n| unknown and addend unknown problems, they will record situation equations (equations in |  |  |\\n| which the operation and order of numbers matches the situation of the problem). Eventually, |  |  |\\n| students notice that a problem may be solved with other solution equations (equations that |  |  |\\n| lead to the answer, but do not match the situation of the story). |  |  |\\n| In a Compare situation, two amounts are compared to find \"How many more\" or \"How many |  |  |\\n| less/fewer\". Students build on their understanding of equal to, more than, and less than for two |  |  |\\n| groups of objects or two numbers. Strategies for determining which the difference in quantities |  |  |\\n| include matching and counting. |  |  |\\n| As First Graders work with a variety of problem types, they extend the sophistication of addition |  |  |\\n| and subtraction methods used in Kindergarten (counting). Now, students use methods of |  |  |\\n| counting on, making ten, and doubles +/- 1 or +/- 2 to solve problems. Students also use a |  |  |\\n| variety of models, including discrete objects and length-based models (e.g., cubes connected |  |  |\\n| to form lengths). |  |  |\\n| In order for students to read and use equations to represent their thinking, they need extensive |  |  |\\n| experiences with addition and subtraction situations in order to connect the experiences with |  |  |\\n| symbols (+, -, =) and equations (5=3+2). In Kindergarten, students demonstrated the |  |  |\\n| understanding of how objects can be joined (addition) and separated (subtraction) by |  |  |\\n| representing addition and subtraction situations using objects, pictures and words. In First |  |  |\\n| Grade, students extend this understanding of addition and subtraction situations to use the |  |  |\\n| addition symbol (+) to represent joining situations, the subtraction symbol (-) to represent |  |  |\\n| separating situations, and the equal sign (=) to represent a relationship regarding quantity |  |  |\\n| between one side of the equation and the other. When solving comparison problems, students |  |  |\\n| may write various equations to represent comparisons. |  |  |\\n| For a complete chart of problem types see page 30. |  |  |\\n\\n# *Represent and solve problems.*\\n\\n**NC.1.OA.2** Represent and solve word problems that call for addition of three whole numbers whose sum is less than or equal to 20, by using objects, drawings, and equations with a symbol for the unknown number.\\n\\n| Clarification | Checking for Understanding |\\n| --- | --- |\\n| Students solve multi-step word problems by adding (joining) three numbers | Mrs. Smith has 4 oatmeal raisin cookies, 5 chocolate chip cookies, and 6 |\\n| whose sum is less than or equal to 20, using a variety of mathematical | gingerbread cookies.

In this standard, they learn to |  |\\n| measure with iterations of non-standard units, using multiple copies of one |  |\\n| object to measure the length of a larger object. These can be labeled length |  |\\n| units. Students will understand that when measuring an object, there should |  |\\n| be no gaps between length units and the length units should not overlap. | Possible Response: I carefully placed paper clips end to end. The pencil |\\n| Students should already have an understanding of direct comparison. | is 5 paper clips long. I thought it would take about 6 paperclips. |\\n|  | Which row is longer? Explain how you know. |\\n| Students will also understand then when different sized units are used to |  |\\n| measure the same object, the sizes of the units must be considered rather |  |\\n| than relying solely on the amount of objects counted. |  |\\n|  | Student Incorrect Response: The row with 6 sticks is longer. Row B is |\\n|  | longer. |\\n|  | Student Correct Response: They are both the same length.

These are non-defining |  |\\n| attributes. |  |\\n| In this standard, students apply their understanding of defining attributes of |  |\\n| shapes in order to create, by building or drawing, given shapes. |  |\\n| Students should be able to describe the two-dimensional shapes they build |  |\\n| by telling the number of sides and vertices it has. Students should be able to |  |\\n| identify the vertex (corner) as the location where to sides meet; however, it is |  |\\n| not necessary for 1st grade students to use the term vertex. Through analysis, |  |\\n| students should recognize that the length of sides is an important attribute |  |\\n| when naming shapes. First grade students should be able to identify the two |  |\\n| dimensional shapes that are the faces of three-dimensional shapes. |  |\\n| Identifying the number of edges and vertices on a three-dimensional shape is |  |\\n| not an expectation of first grade. |  |\\n| Note: North Carolina has adopted the exclusive definition for a trapezoid.

Students should recognize that when something is cut into two equal pieces, each piece will equal one-half of its original whole. Students should also recognize that halves of two different wholes are not necessarily the same size, and they should understand that decomposing equal shares into more equal shares results in smaller equal shares. Students should partition regions into equal shares using a context (e.g., cookies, pies, pizza). Through experiences with multiple representations, students should use the words, *halves* and *fourths,* and the phrases *half of*  and *fourth of* to describe their thinking and solutions. Working with the \"the whole\", students understand that \"the whole\" is composed of two halves or four fourths. How can you and a friend share equally (partition) this piece of paper so that you both have the same amount of paper to paint a picture? *Possible responses:* Student A *I would split the paper right down the middle. That gives us 2 halves. I have half of the paper and my friend has the other half of the paper.*  Student B *I would split it from corner to corner (diagonally). She gets half of the paper and I get half of the paper. See, if we cut on the line, the parts are the same size.* You can have only one slice of pizza. Which pizza should you pick your slice from if you want the biggest piece of pizza? The pizzas are the same size and are each divided into equal pieces. Explain how you know. Return to Standards *Possible response: I would get more pizza if I took a slice from the pizza that is cut into two equal parts. The more equal slices there are, the smaller the pieces get. I wouldn\\'t get as much pizza if I only got a fourth of the pizza instead of half of the pizza.*\\n\\n|  |  | Result Unknown | Change Unknown | Start Unknown |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n|  |  | Two birds sat in a tree.

In rich settings in |\\n|  | problems and | which informal and formal possibilities for solving problems are numerous, young children develop the ability to focus attention, test |\\n| persevere in |  | hypotheses, take reasonable risks, remain flexible, try alternatives, exhibit self-regulation, and persevere (Copley, 2010). Using both |\\n| solving them. |  | verbal and nonverbal means, kindergarten students begin to explain to themselves and others the meaning of a problem, look for ways |\\n|  |  | to solve it, and determine if their thinking makes sense or if another strategy is needed. As the teacher uses thoughtful questioning and |\\n|  |  | provides opportunities for students to share thinking, kindergarten students begin to reason as they become more conscious of what |\\n|  |  | they know and how they solve problems. |\\n| 2. | Reason abstractly | Mathematically proficient students in Kindergarten begin to use numerals to represent specific amount (quantity). For example, a |\\n|  | and quantitatively. | student may write the numeral \"11\" to represent an amount of objects counted, select the correct number card \"17\" to follow \"16\" on the |\\n|  |  | calendar, or build a pile of counters depending on the number drawn. In addition, kindergarten students begin to draw pictures, |\\n|  |  | manipulate objects, use diagrams or charts, etc. to express quantitative ideas such as a joining situation (Mary has 3 bears. Juanita |\\n|  |  | gave her 1 more bear. How many bears does Mary have altogether?), or a separating situation (Mary had 5 bears. She gave some to |\\n|  |  | Juanita. Now she has 3 bears. How many bears did Mary give Juanita?). Using the language developed through numerous joining |\\n|  |  | and separating scenarios, kindergarten students begin to understand how symbols (+, -, =) are used to represent quantitative ideas in a |\\n|  |  | written format. |\\n| 3. | Construct viable | In Kindergarten, mathematically proficient students begin to clearly express, explain, organize and consolidate their math thinking using |\\n|  | arguments and | both verbal and written representations. Through opportunities that encourage exploration, discovery, and discussion, kindergarten |\\n| critique the |  | students begin to learn how to express opinions, become skillful at listening to others, describe their reasoning and respond to others\\' |\\n| reasoning of |  | thinking and reasoning. They begin to develop the ability to reason and analyze situations as they consider questions such as, \"Are |\\n| others. |  | you sure…?\" , \"Do you think that would happen all the time…?\", and \"I wonder why…?\" |\\n| 4. | Model with | Mathematically proficient students in Kindergarten begin to experiment with representing real-life problem situations in multiple ways |\\n| mathematics. |  | such as with numbers, words (mathematical language), drawings, objects, acting out, charts, lists, and number sentences. For |\\n|  |  | example, when making toothpick designs to represent the various combinations of the number \"5\", the student writes the numerals for |\\n|  |  | the various parts (such as \"4\" and \"1\") or selects a number sentence that represents that particular situation (such as 5 = 4 + 1)*. |\\n|  |  | *Kindergarten students should see addition and subtraction equations, but it is not required\". |\\n| 5. | Use appropriate | In Kindergarten, mathematically proficient students begin to explore various tools and use them to investigate mathematical concepts. |\\n|  | tools strategically. | Through multiple opportunities to examine materials, they experiment and use both concrete materials (e.g. 3-dimensional solids, |\\n|  |  | connecting cubes, ten frames, number balances) and technological materials (e.g., virtual manipulatives, calculators, interactive |\\n|  |  | websites) to explore mathematical concepts. Based on these experiences, they become able to decide which tools may be helpful to |\\n|  |  | use depending on the problem or task. For example, when solving the problem, \"There are 4 dogs in the park. 3 more dogs show up in |\\n|  |  | the park. How many dogs are in the park?\", students may decide to act it out using counters and a story mat; draw a picture; or use a |\\n|  |  | handful of cubes. |\\n| 6. | Attend to | Mathematically proficient students in Kindergarten begin to express their ideas and reasoning using words. As their mathematical |\\n| precision. |  | vocabulary increases due to exposure, modeling, and practice, kindergarteners become more precise in their communication, |\\n|  |  | calculations, and measurements. In all types of mathematical tasks, students begin to describe their actions and strategies more |\\n|  |  | clearly, understand and use grade-level appropriate vocabulary accurately, and begin to give precise explanations and reasoning |\\n|  |  | regarding their process of finding solutions. For example, a student may use color words (such as blue, green, light blue) and |\\n|  |  | descriptive words (such as small, big, rough, smooth) to accurately describe how a collection of buttons is sorted. |\\n\\n| 7. | Look for and | Mathematically proficient students in Kindergarten begin to look for patterns and structures in the number system and other areas of |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n|  | make use of | mathematics. For example, when searching for triangles around the room, kindergarteners begin to notice that some triangles are |\\n|  | structure. | larger than others or come in different colors- yet they are all triangles. While exploring the part-whole relationships of a number using a |\\n|  |  | number balance, students begin to realize that 5 can be broken down into sub-parts, such as 4 and 1 or 4 and 2, and still remain a total |\\n|  |  | of 5. |\\n| 8. | Look for and | In Kindergarten, mathematically proficient students begin to notice repetitive actions in geometry, counting, comparing, etc. For |\\n|  | express regularity | example, a kindergartener may notice that as the number of sides increase on a shape, a new shape is created (triangle has 3 sides, a |\\n|  | in repeated | rectangle has 4 sides, a pentagon has 5 sides, a hexagon has 6 sides). When counting out loud to 100, kindergartners may recognize |\\n|  | reasoning. | the pattern 1-9 being repeated for each decade (e.g., Seventy-ONE, Seventy-TWO, Seventy-THREE… Eighty-ONE, Eighty-TWO, |\\n|  |  | Eighty-THREE…). When joining one more cube to a pile, the child may realize that the new amount is the next number in the count |\\n|  |  | sequence. |\\n\\n# **Counting and Cardinality**\\n\\n*Know number names and the counting sequence.*\\n\\n**NC.K.CC.1** Know number names and recognize patterns in the counting sequence by:\\n\\n- Counting to 100 by ones.\\n### • Counting to 100 by tens.\\n\\n| Clarification |  | Checking for Understanding |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| In this standard, students rote count by starting at one and counting to 100. |  | Start at 1 and count by ones. |\\n| • | When counting by ones, students need to understand that the next | Students should be able to count correctly to 100 by ones without |\\n| number in the sequence is one more. |  | skipping numbers, repeating numbers, or hesitating. |\\n| • | When students count by tens they are only expected to master |  |\\n| counting on the decade (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 …).

The expectation |  |\\n| is that students are proficient with these skills (with numbers 1-20) by |  |\\n| the end of Kindergarten. |  |\\n| • When frequently shown small sets of items, students develop the |  |\\n| ability to instantly recognize the quantity in a set without counting |  |\\n| (perceptual subitizing). Most individuals can perceptually subitize up |  |\\n| to sets of five. Perceptual subitizing is a crucial early skill. It |  |\\n| strengthens students\\' ability to efficiently and flexibly determine \"how |  |\\n| many\" when working with larger sets and supports work with |  |\\n| composing and decomposing quantities. Perceptual subitizing is also |  |\\n| a precursor to place value (e.g., groupings of tens) as it gives |  |\\n| students the opportunity to see a collection of items as a unit, rather |  |\\n| than individual items. |  |\\n| • There are two types of subitizing: perceptual and conceptual. This |  |\\n| standard focuses on perceptual subitizing. See standard NC.K.OA.6 |  |\\n| for information about conceptual subitizing. |  |\\n\\nReturn to Standards\\n\\n## *Count to tell the number of objects.*\\n\\n**NC.K.CC.5** Count to answer \"How many?\" in the following situations:\\n\\n- Given a number from 1–20, count out that many objects.\\n- Given up to 20 objects, name the next successive number when an object is added, recognizing the quantity is one more/greater.\\n- Given 20 objects arranged in a line, a rectangular array, and a circle, identify how many.\\n- Given 10 objects in a scattered arrangement, identify how many.\\n\\n| Clarification | Checking for Understanding |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- |\\n| When counting to answer \"how many\", students employ two big | \"Producing a Set\" Task: |  |\\n| understandings from NC.K.CC.4: one-to-one correspondence and cardinality. | • | Teacher places a bowl of objects on table and asks student to count out |\\n| They say one number for each item counted (one-to-one correspondence) | a set of 15 objects. |  |\\n| and know the last number counted tells the quantity of the set (cardinality). | • | Student removes 15 objects from the bowl and places them on the |\\n| • This standard asks that students are both counters and producers. |  | table while counting aloud. |\\n| o Producer: When given a number, a student counts out a set | • | Teacher adds one more object to the set of 15, and asks, \"How many |\\n| of objects or draw a picture to match. | are there now?\" |  |\\n| o Counter: When given a set of objects or drawings, a student |  | Rather than re-counting the entire set, the student says the next number in the |\\n| counts to determine \"how many\". | counting sequence…16. |  |\\n| • After numerous experiences with counting objects, along with the |  |  |\\n| developmental understanding that a group of objects counted | \"Counting a Set\" Task: | Given a set of cards, students count the quantity of stars |\\n| multiple times will remain the same amount, students recognize the | in each arrangement. |  |\\n| need for keeping track in order to determine \"how many\". Some |  |  |\\n| arrangements, such as a line or rectangular array, are easier to |  |  |\\n| count. However, they may limit students\\' flexibility with developing |  |  |\\n| meaningful tracking strategies, so providing multiple arrangements |  |  |\\n| help children learn how to keep track. Since scattered arrangements |  |  |\\n| are the most challenging, this standard specifies that students only |  |  |\\n| count up to 10 objects in a scattered arrangement and count up to 20 |  |  |\\n| objects in a line, rectangular array, or circle. Depending on the |  |  |\\n| amount of objects to be counted, and students\\' confidence with |  |  |\\n| counting a set of objects, students may move the objects as they |  |  |\\n| count each, point to each object as counted, look without touching |  |  |\\n| when counting, or use a combination of these strategies. |  |  |\\n| • An important component of this standard is that of naming the next |  |  |\\n| successive number when an object is added to a set, which is based |  |  |\\n| on the idea of inclusion. Inclusion is the understanding that numbers |  |  |\\n| build by exactly one each time and that they nest within each other by |  |  |\\n| this amount. A set of three objects is nested within a set of 4 objects; |  |  |\\n| within this same set of 4 objects is also a set of two objects and a set |  |  |\\n| of one. Using this understanding, if a student has four objects and |  |  |\\n| wants to have 5 objects, the student is able to add one more |  |  |\\n| knowing that four is within, or a sub-part of, 5 (rather than removing |  |  |\\n| all 4 objects and starting over to make a new set of 5). This concept |  |  |\\n| is critical for the later development of part/whole relationships. |  |  |\\n\\n#### *Compare numbers.*\\n\\n**NC.K.CC.6** Identify whether the number of objects, within 10, in one group is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of objects in another group, by using matching and counting strategies.\\n\\n| Clarification | Checking for Understanding |  |  |\\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\\n| This standard calls for students to use their counting ability to compare two |  | Students are given a set of triangles and a set of squares.

Therefore, before introducing symbols (+, -, =) and |  |\\n| equations, kindergarteners require numerous experiences using addition and |  |\\n| subtraction vocabulary in order to attach meaning to the various symbols.

For example, when justifying why a particular shape isn\\'t a square, a first grade student |\\n| critique the |  | may hold up a picture of a rectangle, pointing to the various parts, and reason, \"It can\\'t be a square because, even though it has 4 sides |\\n| reasoning of |  | and 4 angles, the sides aren\\'t all the same size.\" In a classroom where risk-taking and varying perspectives are encouraged, |\\n| others. |  | mathematically proficient students are willing and eager to share their ideas with others, consider other ideas proposed by classmates, |\\n|  |  | and question ideas that don\\'t seem to make sense.

When measuring an object, students check to make sure that there are not any |\\n|  |  | gaps or overlaps as they carefully place each unit end to end to measure the object (iterating length units). Mathematically proficient first |\\n|  |  | grade students understand the symbols they use (=, >,<) and use clear explanations in discussions with others.
