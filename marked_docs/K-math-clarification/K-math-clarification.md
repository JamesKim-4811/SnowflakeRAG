**North Carolina Course of Study – Kindergarten Standards**

# **Standards for Mathematical Practice**

| Practice |  | Explanation and Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1. | Make sense of | Mathematically proficient students in Kindergarten begin to develop effective dispositions toward problem solving. In rich settings in |
|  | problems and | which informal and formal possibilities for solving problems are numerous, young children develop the ability to focus attention, test |
| persevere in |  | hypotheses, take reasonable risks, remain flexible, try alternatives, exhibit self-regulation, and persevere (Copley, 2010). Using both |
| solving them. |  | verbal and nonverbal means, kindergarten students begin to explain to themselves and others the meaning of a problem, look for ways |
|  |  | to solve it, and determine if their thinking makes sense or if another strategy is needed. As the teacher uses thoughtful questioning and |
|  |  | provides opportunities for students to share thinking, kindergarten students begin to reason as they become more conscious of what |
|  |  | they know and how they solve problems. |
| 2. | Reason abstractly | Mathematically proficient students in Kindergarten begin to use numerals to represent specific amount (quantity). For example, a |
|  | and quantitatively. | student may write the numeral "11" to represent an amount of objects counted, select the correct number card "17" to follow "16" on the |
|  |  | calendar, or build a pile of counters depending on the number drawn. In addition, kindergarten students begin to draw pictures, |
|  |  | manipulate objects, use diagrams or charts, etc. to express quantitative ideas such as a joining situation (Mary has 3 bears. Juanita |
|  |  | gave her 1 more bear. How many bears does Mary have altogether?), or a separating situation (Mary had 5 bears. She gave some to |
|  |  | Juanita. Now she has 3 bears. How many bears did Mary give Juanita?). Using the language developed through numerous joining |
|  |  | and separating scenarios, kindergarten students begin to understand how symbols (+, -, =) are used to represent quantitative ideas in a |
|  |  | written format. |
| 3. | Construct viable | In Kindergarten, mathematically proficient students begin to clearly express, explain, organize and consolidate their math thinking using |
|  | arguments and | both verbal and written representations. Through opportunities that encourage exploration, discovery, and discussion, kindergarten |
| critique the |  | students begin to learn how to express opinions, become skillful at listening to others, describe their reasoning and respond to others' |
| reasoning of |  | thinking and reasoning. They begin to develop the ability to reason and analyze situations as they consider questions such as, "Are |
| others. |  | you sure…?" , "Do you think that would happen all the time…?", and "I wonder why…?" |
| 4. | Model with | Mathematically proficient students in Kindergarten begin to experiment with representing real-life problem situations in multiple ways |
| mathematics. |  | such as with numbers, words (mathematical language), drawings, objects, acting out, charts, lists, and number sentences. For |
|  |  | example, when making toothpick designs to represent the various combinations of the number "5", the student writes the numerals for |
|  |  | the various parts (such as "4" and "1") or selects a number sentence that represents that particular situation (such as 5 = 4 + 1)*. |
|  |  | *Kindergarten students should see addition and subtraction equations, but it is not required". |
| 5. | Use appropriate | In Kindergarten, mathematically proficient students begin to explore various tools and use them to investigate mathematical concepts. |
|  | tools strategically. | Through multiple opportunities to examine materials, they experiment and use both concrete materials (e.g. 3-dimensional solids, |
|  |  | connecting cubes, ten frames, number balances) and technological materials (e.g., virtual manipulatives, calculators, interactive |
|  |  | websites) to explore mathematical concepts. Based on these experiences, they become able to decide which tools may be helpful to |
|  |  | use depending on the problem or task. For example, when solving the problem, "There are 4 dogs in the park. 3 more dogs show up in |
|  |  | the park. How many dogs are in the park?", students may decide to act it out using counters and a story mat; draw a picture; or use a |
|  |  | handful of cubes. |
| 6. | Attend to | Mathematically proficient students in Kindergarten begin to express their ideas and reasoning using words. As their mathematical |
| precision. |  | vocabulary increases due to exposure, modeling, and practice, kindergarteners become more precise in their communication, |
|  |  | calculations, and measurements. In all types of mathematical tasks, students begin to describe their actions and strategies more |
|  |  | clearly, understand and use grade-level appropriate vocabulary accurately, and begin to give precise explanations and reasoning |
|  |  | regarding their process of finding solutions. For example, a student may use color words (such as blue, green, light blue) and |
|  |  | descriptive words (such as small, big, rough, smooth) to accurately describe how a collection of buttons is sorted. |

| 7. | Look for and | Mathematically proficient students in Kindergarten begin to look for patterns and structures in the number system and other areas of |
| --- | --- | --- |
|  | make use of | mathematics. For example, when searching for triangles around the room, kindergarteners begin to notice that some triangles are |
|  | structure. | larger than others or come in different colors- yet they are all triangles. While exploring the part-whole relationships of a number using a |
|  |  | number balance, students begin to realize that 5 can be broken down into sub-parts, such as 4 and 1 or 4 and 2, and still remain a total |
|  |  | of 5. |
| 8. | Look for and | In Kindergarten, mathematically proficient students begin to notice repetitive actions in geometry, counting, comparing, etc. For |
|  | express regularity | example, a kindergartener may notice that as the number of sides increase on a shape, a new shape is created (triangle has 3 sides, a |
|  | in repeated | rectangle has 4 sides, a pentagon has 5 sides, a hexagon has 6 sides). When counting out loud to 100, kindergartners may recognize |
|  | reasoning. | the pattern 1-9 being repeated for each decade (e.g., Seventy-ONE, Seventy-TWO, Seventy-THREE… Eighty-ONE, Eighty-TWO, |
|  |  | Eighty-THREE…). When joining one more cube to a pile, the child may realize that the new amount is the next number in the count |
|  |  | sequence. |

# **Counting and Cardinality**

*Know number names and the counting sequence.*

**NC.K.CC.1** Know number names and recognize patterns in the counting sequence by:

- Counting to 100 by ones.
### • Counting to 100 by tens.

| Clarification |  | Checking for Understanding |
| --- | --- | --- |
| In this standard, students rote count by starting at one and counting to 100. |  | Start at 1 and count by ones. |
| • | When counting by ones, students need to understand that the next | Students should be able to count correctly to 100 by ones without |

| • | When students count by tens they are only expected to master |  |
| counting on the decade (0, 10, 20, 30, 40 …). Students need to |  | Start at 10 and count by tens. |
| understand that the next number in the sequence is "ten more" (or |  | Students should be able to count correctly to 100 by tens without skipping |

| The focus of this standard is on using patterns in the number sequence to |  |  |
| count. It does not require recognition of numerals or writing numerals. |  |  |

| Know number names and the counting sequence. |  |

| NC.K.CC.3 Write numbers from 0 to 20. Represent a number of objects with a written numeral 0-20, with 0 representing a count of no objects. |  |
| Clarification | Checking for Understanding |
| This standard calls for students to recognize and write numerals 0-20. | As the teacher says a number aloud, the student records the written numeral: |
| • When shown a set within 20, students record the quantity by |  |
| selecting the appropriate number card/tile (numeral recognition) or |  |
| writing the numeral. |  |
| • When given a numeral, students create a set of items to represent |  |

| handwriting formation of the actual numeral itself. While children may |  |
| experiment with writing numbers beyond 20, this standard places emphasis |  |
| on numbers 0-20. |  |
|  | Return to Standards |

## *Count to tell the number of objects.*

**NC.K.CC.4** Understand the relationship between numbers and quantities.

- When counting objects, say the number names in the standard order, pairing each object with one and only one number name and each number name with one and only one object (one-to-one correspondence).
- Recognize that the last number named tells the number of objects counted regardless of their arrangement (cardinality).

• State the number of objects in a group, of up to 5 objects, without counting the objects (perceptual subitizing).

| Clarification | Checking for Understanding |
| --- | --- |
| When given frequent opportunities to count sets of objects, students develop | Student is given a tray of buttons and asked to count the set. After counting, |
| counting skills and discover the relationship between quantity and number. | the teacher says, "How many buttons are in this set?" Then, the teacher |
| • Students implement correct counting behaviors by moving or pointing | rearranges the buttons (without adding to or taking from the set). The student |

| counting word for every object (synchrony/ one-to-one tagging), while |  |
| keeping track of objects that have and have not been counted. This is |  |
| the foundation of counting. | Student is shown a "quick image" card for 2-3 seconds and asked to tell "how |

| and understanding that the last number stated (…8, 9, 10) represents | the number (perceptual subitizing). Steps are repeated with additional cards. |
| the total amount of objects: "There are 10 bears in this pile." Since an |  |
| important goal for children is to count with meaning, it is important to |  |
| have children answer the question, "How many?" after they count. |  |
| Often, children who have not developed cardinality will count the |  |
| amount again, not realizing that the 10 they stated means 10 objects |  |
| in all. |  |
| • One-to-one correspondence and cardinality are higher-level skills, |  |
| which require students to analyze, reason about, and explain |  |
| relationships between numbers and sets of objects. The expectation |  |
| is that students are proficient with these skills (with numbers 1-20) by |  |
| the end of Kindergarten. |  |
| • When frequently shown small sets of items, students develop the |  |
| ability to instantly recognize the quantity in a set without counting |  |
| (perceptual subitizing). Most individuals can perceptually subitize up |  |
| to sets of five. Perceptual subitizing is a crucial early skill. It |  |
| strengthens students' ability to efficiently and flexibly determine "how |  |
| many" when working with larger sets and supports work with |  |
| composing and decomposing quantities. Perceptual subitizing is also |  |
| a precursor to place value (e.g., groupings of tens) as it gives |  |
| students the opportunity to see a collection of items as a unit, rather |  |
| than individual items. |  |
| • There are two types of subitizing: perceptual and conceptual. This |  |
| standard focuses on perceptual subitizing. See standard NC.K.OA.6 |  |
| for information about conceptual subitizing. |  |

## *Count to tell the number of objects.*

**NC.K.CC.5** Count to answer "How many?" in the following situations:

- Given a number from 1–20, count out that many objects.
- Given up to 20 objects, name the next successive number when an object is added, recognizing the quantity is one more/greater.
- Given 20 objects arranged in a line, a rectangular array, and a circle, identify how many.
- Given 10 objects in a scattered arrangement, identify how many.

| Clarification | Checking for Understanding |  |

| • After numerous experiences with counting objects, along with the |  |  |
| developmental understanding that a group of objects counted | "Counting a Set" Task: | Given a set of cards, students count the quantity of stars |
| multiple times will remain the same amount, students recognize the | in each arrangement. |  |
| need for keeping track in order to determine "how many". Some |  |  |
| arrangements, such as a line or rectangular array, are easier to |  |  |
| count. However, they may limit students' flexibility with developing |  |  |
| meaningful tracking strategies, so providing multiple arrangements |  |  |
| help children learn how to keep track. Since scattered arrangements |  |  |
| are the most challenging, this standard specifies that students only |  |  |
| count up to 10 objects in a scattered arrangement and count up to 20 |  |  |
| objects in a line, rectangular array, or circle. Depending on the |  |  |
| amount of objects to be counted, and students' confidence with |  |  |
| counting a set of objects, students may move the objects as they |  |  |
| count each, point to each object as counted, look without touching |  |  |
| when counting, or use a combination of these strategies. |  |  |
| • An important component of this standard is that of naming the next |  |  |
| successive number when an object is added to a set, which is based |  |  |
| on the idea of inclusion. Inclusion is the understanding that numbers |  |  |
| build by exactly one each time and that they nest within each other by |  |  |
| this amount. A set of three objects is nested within a set of 4 objects; |  |  |
| within this same set of 4 objects is also a set of two objects and a set |  |  |
| of one. Using this understanding, if a student has four objects and |  |  |
| wants to have 5 objects, the student is able to add one more |  |  |
| knowing that four is within, or a sub-part of, 5 (rather than removing |  |  |
| all 4 objects and starting over to make a new set of 5). This concept |  |  |
| is critical for the later development of part/whole relationships. |  |  |

#### *Compare numbers.*

**NC.K.CC.6** Identify whether the number of objects, within 10, in one group is greater than, less than, or equal to the number of objects in another group, by using matching and counting strategies.

## *Understand addition and subtraction.*

**NC.K.OA.1** Represent addition and subtraction, within 10:

- Use a variety of representations such as objects, fingers, mental images, drawings, sounds, acting out situations, verbal explanations, or expressions.
- Demonstrate understanding of addition and subtraction by making connections among representations.

|  | Possible response: |
| This standard develops the understanding that addition and subtraction of | I drew two red candies and three green candies. I put them together to |

| Situations that can be represented by addition or subtraction can be |  |

| standard, students build on their counting skills and continue to establish one |  |
| to-one correspondence by moving, touching, or pointing to concrete objects |  |
| that they are counting as they say corresponding number words (NCTM). |  |
| This standard is focused on understanding the concept of addition and |  |
| subtraction, rather than reading and solving addition and subtraction number |  |
| sentences (equations). Therefore, before introducing symbols (+, -, =) and |  |
| equations, kindergarteners require numerous experiences using addition and |  |
| subtraction vocabulary in order to attach meaning to the various symbols. For |  |
| example, when explaining a solution, kindergartens may state, "Three and |  |
| two is the same amount as 5." While the meaning of the equal sign is not |  |
| introduced as a standard until First Grade, if equations are going to be |  |
| modeled and used in Kindergarten, students must connect the symbol (=) |  |
| with its meaning (is the same amount/quantity as). |  |

# *Understand addition and subtraction.*

**NC.K.OA.2** Solve addition and subtraction word problems, within 10, using objects or drawings to represent the problem, when solving:

- Add to/Take From-Result Unknown
- Put Together/ Take Apart (Total Unknown and Two Addends Unknown)

| In this standard, students apply their work from NC.K.OA.1 to solve addition |
| --- |
| and subtraction problems involving a variety of situations. |
| Kindergarten students work with four problem types (see chart: Kindergarten |
| Problem Types). The first two problem types involve an action; something is |
| physically added to or taken from the starting amount. The last two problem |
| types do not involve an action; students work with part-part-whole |
| relationships. They may know the amounts in each part, and solve to the find |
| whole amount. Or, students may be given the whole amount, and find the |
| amount in each part. |

Early problem solvers should be encouraged to act out the problem situation with concrete objects. Eventually, students will transition to using drawings, numbers, and words to represent their work. Drawings need not show details, but should show the mathematics in the problems.
